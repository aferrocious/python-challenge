# Python-Challenge

**PyBank:**
Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:

  - The total number of months included in the dataset
  - The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
  - The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
  - The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
  - The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

Xpert Learning Assistant and ChatGPT were utilized to assist in code, particularly in calculating the profit/losses for each month, identifying the increases/decreases, and preparing the financial analysis summary to be printed to txt.

**PyPoll:**
Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:

  - The total number of votes cast
  - A complete list of candidates who received votes
  - The percentage of votes each candidate won
  - The total number of votes each candidate won
  - The winner of the election based on popular vote

Mirrored similar formatting from PyBank exercise and then Utilized ChatGPT to assist in code for getting candidates to appear on their own lines with individual calculations, in the correct order. Also worked on reiterations to simplify the code as much as possible.
